# Garlic-Bread
Objective: To provide a smooth and easy travel experience for road trips and also provide an option to interact with strangers having the same zeal to explore and travel. It is an interactive dashboard that acts as a travel assistant with many interesting and useful features, as listed below:

1. A music recommendation feature that plays the song based on your mood, current location and current weather.
2. It has live weather monitoring for the destination.
3. It displays the nearest services (hotels, fuel stations and so on) to the car at any point of time.
4. It shows the souvenirs typical to a specific place, suggesting the users what to look for in their destination.
5. It shows your entire travel history.
6. Users can also connect with like minded travelling partners who are destined to the same place for both a community feel as well as for times of emergency.
7. Schedule a futute trip and get an idea of the meetup probability.
